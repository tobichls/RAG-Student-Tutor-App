# RAG Student Tutor Application

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to act as a personal tutor for university students, using their own lecture slides to provide accurate, verifiable answers and mitigate the risk of LLM hallucinations.

## The Problem

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for learning, but they are prone to "hallucination"â€”generating confident but incorrect information. For students relying on these models for academic work, this can lead to misconceptions and flawed understanding of complex topics.

## The Solution

This application addresses the issue of LLM reliability by grounding its responses in a student's own course materials. It uses a RAG architecture to ensure that every answer is generated directly from specific, citable text chunks from uploaded lecture slides.

### Key Features

- **Verifiable Responses**: The UI displays the exact text chunks used to generate an answer, allowing students to instantly fact-check the source material.
- **Graph-Based Indexing**: Lecture content is stored in a Neo4j knowledge graph and indexed by academic concepts, enabling highly relevant and efficient semantic search.
- **Custom NLP Model**: A custom-trained spaCy NER model identifies key academic concepts, improving the precision of the retrieval process.
- **Local & Secure**: All data handling and model interactions are managed locally, ensuring user privacy and faster performance compared to API-based solutions.

## Future Development Roadmap

### Core Feature Enhancements

- [ ] **Conversation Memory**: Implement context retention for follow-up questions.
- [ ] **Multi-Modal Support**: Add capabilities to process and describe images and diagrams.
- [ ] **Expanded File Support**: Allow uploads of various file types beyond PDFs.

### Model & Architecture Improvements

- [ ] **LLM Flexibility**: Create a modular system to easily switch between different LLMs.
- [ ] **NER Model Training**: Further train the NER model on diverse lecture slides to recognize a wider range of entities (e.g., `Theories`, `Key Terms`).
- [ ] **Discipline-Specific Knowledge Graphs**: Develop clustered knowledge graphs tailored to specific academic fields (e.g., Computer Science, Biology).
- [ ] **Query Optimization Agent**: Introduce an agent layer to analyze and refine user queries for more accurate retrieval.

### Integrity & Safety

- [ ] **Academic Integrity Guardrails**: Develop mechanisms to detect and flag queries that could promote academic misconduct.
